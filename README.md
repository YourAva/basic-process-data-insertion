# Basic Process Data Insertion (MALWARE) üß®
This is a small project I've recently made that allows someone to use a shell script inserted into a windows process. I decided to embark on the adventure of malware dev to get a better understanding of how malware works so I can understand how to defend against it. I'm highly interested in cybersecurity so decided it could be a fun project.

## Disclaimer ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
‚ùó‚ùó **-- This project is MALWARE. Granted, it's not that strong and is highly detectable by antivirus, but I feel it's important to be clear that this can be abused.**

I've absolutely loved his content as he delivers the information in a fun way, that makes me actually enjoy learning, I highly recommend his malware dev playlist.
- [Win32 API Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_processthreadsapi/) -- Obviously, the win32API docs came in handy quite a lot to understand what I'm actually doing. I don't really like microsoft, but they did a good job documenting how I can make malware for their systems! :)
